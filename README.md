# Kahoot-Exploiter
Kahoot Exploiter is made by Wrench, the primary goal of this library of code is to make cheating easier cause who doesn't like cheating? Kahoot Exploiter is using  [Theusaf's KahootAPI-Updated](https://github.com/theusaf/kahoot.js-updated) to pull quiz informations from the provided QuizID or the quiz name through a search... wich means this exploit will saddly not work if the quiz is not public unless kahoot made an official API that allows us to view any quiz which probably will never happen.

Usage
-----
You will need a javascript environment, so you can either code your client in browser JS or Node.JS, I'd suggest using NodeJS.
